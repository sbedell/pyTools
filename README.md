pyTools
=======

A collection of various small python scripts I've written.

A fair warning - these are all works in progress, most of these are not fully functional yet. Hopefully you enjoy using them :). 

craigslist - A basic Craigslist scraper / search-bot.

dict - Generates a wordlist/dictionary based on a user-selected website.

geoIP - Looks up IP addresses or entire files of IP addresses and geolocates them. 

passphrase - A simple passphrase generator based on given wordlists

wordscramble - Stcineitss say ppeloe can raed snenteces lkie tihs as lnog as the fsirt and lsat leertts are in the rhgit palce. This script takes a wordlist or sentence and outputs it scrambled like the previous sentence.

wordlists - Just a folder full of sample wordlists to be used with the passphrase generator or the word scrambler.
