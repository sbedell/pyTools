pyTools
=======

This is a collection of various small python scripts I've written.

A fair warning - these are all works in progress, some of these are not fully functional yet. Hopefully you enjoy using them :). 

craigslist
------
A basic Craigslist scraper / search-bot. <br>
This is still a work in progress. Basic searching through Ohio is working but that's about it.

geoIP
------
Looks up IP addresses or entire files of IP addresses and geolocates them. 

passphrase
------
A simple passphrase generator based on given wordlists.

More information on passphrases: [xkcd.com/936](http://www.xkcd.com/936/)

wordscramble
------
Stcineitss say ppeloe can raed snenteces lkie tihs as lnog as the fsirt and lsat leertts are in the rhgit palce.

This script takes a wordlist or sentence and outputs it scrambled like the previous sentence.

wordlistCreator
------
Generates a word list based on a website or text file.

Useful for feeding into the passpharse generator or word scrambler.

wordlists
------
Just a folder full of sample wordlists to be used with the passphrase generator or the word scrambler.
